## Project Overview

This project is for the development of a game called "Chicken Jump". The game is about a chicken trying to get back to its barn, navigating through various levels and obstacles.

**Game Concept:**

*   **Objective:** The player controls a chicken that needs to reach its barn.
*   **Levels & Obstacles:** The game has multiple levels with increasing difficulty. Obstacles include rivers, roads, foxes, and a farmer in a truck.
*   **Scoring & Items:** Players can collect corn to gain points and find hidden survival items.
*   **Lives:** The chicken has three lives. Losing all lives ends the game.
*   **Time Limit:** The chicken must reach the barn before night to avoid being eaten by a fox and before the farmer collects the chickens.
*   **High Score & Store:** The game features a hall of fame for high scores and a store where players can spend points on items like extra lives.

This is a game for playing and having fun!

This game is about a chicken trying to make  its way back to his barn but first
he has to get pass different levels and obstacles for example rivers, roads, and
he has to find corn to gain points. Also he needs to find different survival
items hidden through out the game. Another example of an obstacle is a fox that
is trying to catch the chicken. Another obstacle is a farmer that is trying to
hit the chicken with his truck. The chicken has three lives and if he loses all
three lives the game is over. The chicken has to get to the barn before night
time or else he will be eaten by a fox. Lastly the chicken has to get to the
barn before the farmer comes to collect his chickens. Thats just level one there
are many more levels with different obstacles and survival items to find and
each level gets harder and harder. And if each level you complete you get points
and if you get a high score you can enter your name in the hall of fame and you
can spend your points on different items in the store like more lives. Remember
"AI" be creative and make up more levels and obstacles and survival items. Make
sure to have fun!
